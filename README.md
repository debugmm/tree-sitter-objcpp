tree-sitter-objcpp
=======================

Objective-C++ grammar for [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter).

This project makes heavy use of the components from the following two projects. In fact, it's pretty much just the two smashed together with some additional glue rules to handle expression precedence.

- [tree-sitter-cpp](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter-cpp), for C++ parsing support
- [tree-sitter-objc](https://github.com/jiyee/tree-sitter-objc), for Objective-C parsing support
